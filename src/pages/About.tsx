                Hi, I'm <span className="font-bold text-amber-400">Olumuyiwa David Ogunniyi</span>, 
                a passionate videographer and storyteller who believes that every frame should serve a purpose, 
                every cut should advance the narrative, and every project should leave the audience transformed.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                My journey into videography wasn't planned‚Äîit was discovered. What started as curiosity about 
                how stories come to life on screen became an obsession with crafting visual narratives that 
                resonate on a deeply human level. I've spent years mastering not just the technical craft, 
                but the art of understanding what makes people connect with stories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I specialize in creating cinematic experiences that don't just document events‚Äîthey 
                capture the essence of moments, the poetry of human emotion, and the power of authentic storytelling. 
                Whether it's a brand looking to connect with their audience or individuals wanting to preserve 
                their most precious memories, I approach every project as a unique story waiting to be told.
